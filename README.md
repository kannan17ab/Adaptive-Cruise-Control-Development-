# Adaptive-Cruise-Control-Development-
 ACC system for passenger cars to improve driver comfort by automatically adjusting speed and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. It includes standard ACC (active above 30 km/h) for freeways and a stop-and-go mode for low-speed traffic. Built in MATLAB Simulink, it follows MBD processes with Embedded Coder for code generation.
